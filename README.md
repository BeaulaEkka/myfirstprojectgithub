### What I learned

In a first glance, it looked like a piece of cake, but I can assure you it was anything but that. During the course of working on this project, I learnt a lot on responsive layout. I also discovered chrome Dev tools and how to manage and fix issues and do a test run in Chrome.



```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
 
 :root {
--White: hsl(0, 0%, 100%);
--lightgray: hsl(212, 45%, 89%);
--grayishblue: hsl(220, 15%, 55%);
--darkblue: hsl(218, 44%, 22%);
}
}
```



### Continued Development

I realized that I am still wrestling with the grizzly bear-responsiveness! Lot of work needs to be done there.


### Useful resources

- [How to Host a Website On Github](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hrJ4oN1u_8) - This helped me for uploading my first live website on Github. Which can get a bit confusing.
